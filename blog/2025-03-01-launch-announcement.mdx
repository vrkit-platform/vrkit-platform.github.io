As you've gleaned by this point, the basic purpose of `VRKit`
is to provide overlay capabilities that work both via `OpenXR`
as well as your `Desktop`.

This is still PRE-ALPHA.  The current state of the `vrkit-platform` is, simply put, A MESS.

When I originally started working with overlays & respectively all the other functional areas this repo covers, the target was personal use.

A few months ago, I realized if I glue a bunch of my projects together,
it would be pretty cool; and a plan for `VRKit Platform` was hatched.
