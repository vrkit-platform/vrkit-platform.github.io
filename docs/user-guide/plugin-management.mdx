# Plugin Management

> ⚠️ **Warning:** The Plugin system has literally no guard rails in terms of
> what a plugin can functionally access on your system; you are assuming ALL risk,
> so only install plugins from trusted sources and/or develop your own

To find, install, and/or remove plugins, you can either search for
them in the plugins section of the application,
accessible in the left navigation drawer.

> _NOTE: the plugin action button will have one of the
> following labels based on the current state of the selected
> plugin `Install|Uninstall|Development` (Plugin development is documented elsewhere)_
>
> *Internal plugins are not actionable, meaning that the plugin action button is not
> visible as they can not be `Uninstalled|Installed` as demonstrated in the screenshot below.*

### Browsing Plugins w/o the App

When you select an available plugin,
you'll see a button to `Install` it if not already installed.
