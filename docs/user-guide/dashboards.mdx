# Dashboards

In the context of _*VRKit*_, a dashboard is best described as a combination of 1 or more overlays, and
any overlay specific settings as well as the size & positioning for each overlay.

You can create as many dashboards, each with up to 8 overlays, as you choose.

:::tip
You likely will settle on a single dash once you've played around with
overlays and their properties, so be sure to set your favorite as the `Default`.

The default dash is opened upon a connection to iRacing being established
(if no dashboard is currently open).
:::

## List

The dashboard list view is exactly as it sounds.

It's a list of all your dashboards.  You can select a dashboard from the list to open it.  You can also create new dashboards, delete existing dashboards, and set the default dashboard from this view.

### Global Actions

Actions available, which do not affect an existing dashboard.

#### Create New

To create a new dashboard, click the `+ Create` button in the top right corner of the dashboard list view.

### Actions

#### Open/Launch

Open/Launch the dashboard; the [Dashboard Controller](./dashboard-controller) window will pop up & you
are off to the races.


#### Edit Settings for Dashboard & Overlays

#### More Actions

The 3 dots at the far right of the list item presents additional actions.

##### Delete

This will delete the dashboard and all of its overlay configurations.

##### Set as Default

Set the represented dashboard as the default/favorite, which is used
when a connection to iRacing is established, when no other dashboard is
currently open.


## Settings

Dashboard settings allows you to configure things like the dashboard name,
an icon for easy recall, addition and removal of overlays etc.

It also is the place where you can edit overlay specific settings.  For instance,
the Clock overlay settings include a `24hr` mode, which is configured by a boolean/switch value.

:::tip
If you'd like more info related to overlay settings & how to use them, checkout the
developer documentation for [Plugins](/docs/developer/plugins/create-plugin-quick-start).

### Enable Render Targets

By default, both `OpenXR/VR` & `Screen` outputs are enabled; however if you only plan
to use `OpenXR/VR`, you should uncheck `Screen` & visa-versa to save system resources.

### Add Overlay

To add an overlay to a dashboard, in the desired dashboard's settings editor, click the `+ Overlay`
button.

When clicked, the Overlay Picker opens, where you will select the overlay you wish to add as seen below.

You can find additional overlays via the [Plugin Management](./plugin-management) system.

### Remove Overlay

To remove an overlay click the trash can icon to the right of the overlays list entry.

### Overlay Settings

:::info
Overlay positioning & sizing is done interactively & at the moment can not be done manually.

To adjust the layout, Open/Launch the dashboard & click the layout editor button.
:::

As you can see below, the `Leaderboard` overlay currently has just 1 settings, the mode.  The dropdown
allows you to select the mode you'd like to see in this dashboard.

:::tip
You may need to Re-Open/Re-Launch the dashboard after making settings changes in order for them to take effect.
