# Create Plugin Quickstart

> ⚠️ **Warning:** All of this is a WIP, so proceed with care
> & ask questions when and where appropriate.

A plugin provides overlay components defined in their respective
[manifest file (plugin.json5)](https://github.com/vrkit-platform/vrkit-plugin-template/blob/main/plugin.json5), which can be found in the root of the repository.

## Use the Plugin Repo Template

Either click to [Use Template](https://github.com/new?template_name=vrkit-plugin-template&template_owner=vrkit-platform), or navigate to [vrkit-plugin-template](https://github.com/vrkit-platform/vrkit-plugin-template)
and select the "Use this template" button.  Choose a name for your plugin, and then clone
your new plugin from the repository you just created.

## Configuration

The following files must all be modified to properly define
your plugin, enabling others to access it via the `plugin management system`.

- VRKit Plugin [plugin.json5](https://github.com/vrkit-platform/vrkit-plugin-template/blob/main/plugin.json5)
- NPM Package [package.json](https://github.com/vrkit-platform/vrkit-plugin-template/blob/main/package.json)
- GitHub Workflow [.github/workflows/release.yml](https://github.com/vrkit-platform/vrkit-plugin-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml)

## Development & Building

VRKit uses `esbuild` to bundle all the required resources and
capabilities. The required [esbuild.config.js](https://github.com/vrkit-platform/vrkit-plugin-template/blob/main/esbuild.config.js), which
is preconfigured to demonstrate externals, etc is invoked by running
either `yarn build` for production and `yarn dev` for development.

When running `yarn dev`, the process will watch the appropriate source files
and automatically run `esbuild` on source file changes.

## Setup VRKit for Development

Once `dev` or `build` has successfully run at least once, you'll have
a usable bundle that can be used via the VRKit app.

> NOTE: You must link your output directory to the VRKit data directory as follows.

```powershell
# Powershell
# MAKE SURE THE APP IS CLOSED BEFORE DOING THIS
# REPLACE <GENERATE_YOUR_OWN_UUID_V4> APPRORIATELY TO MATCH YOUR `plugin.json5`
New-Item -Path $env:USER_PROFILE\AppData\Local\VRKit\Plugins\<GENERATE_YOUR_OWN_UUID_V4> -Target $PWD -Type SymbolicLink
```

Once you create this link, your overlay will be visible in plugin
management, and you can test it out by adding it to a dashboard.
If you leave the `yarn dev` script running,
you will see updates every time the source changes.

## Release & Publishing

> IMPORTANT: Make sure you use a newly generated UUID in [plugin.json5](https://github.com/vrkit-platform/vrkit-plugin-template/blob/main/plugin.json5)
> & the same UUID when publishing to [vrkit-plugin-manifest](https://github.com/vrkit-platform/vrkit-plugin-manifest)

These processes are taken care of via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/vrkit-platform/vrkit-plugin-template/blob/main/.github/workflows/release.yml).

- When your plugin is ready to publish,
clone [vrkit-plugin-manifest](https://github.com/vrkit-platform/vrkit-plugin-manifest).
- Create a new definition file in the plugins folder
- Submit a pull request.

Once the pull request is accepted & merged, your plugin will
be immediately visible, once the manifest update CRON job runs. The jobs cadence is 3hrs.

> NOTE: The job also updates existing plugins by checking the latest release in GitHub.
> The process for publishing initial releases & updates is tightly
> baked in & makes everything quite easy to manage.
